The tool rental program is a command line interface that provides the user with many different options to rent or purchase tools, return or replace those tools, view the total revenue, transaction history, or inventory. The program is meant to be used in conjunction with a tool rental store. The intended user is the cashier, not the customer. The cashier should prompt the customer using the program’s interface as a guide, but the customer should never have access to the program, due to the user’s ability to wipe the transaction history or re-initialize the inventory.
